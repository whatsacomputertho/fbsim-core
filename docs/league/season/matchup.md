# Matchup module

The `matchup` module defines the `LeagueSeasonMatchup` struct which represents a single game in a league season. It contains the home & away team IDs and scores in the game, as well as a boolean property which identifies whether the game is complete or not. The `matchup` module also defines the `LeagueSeasonMatchups` struct which aggregates matchups for a given team over the course of a season.
