# Matchup module

The `matchup` module includes the `GameMatchup` struct and the `GameMatchupResult` enum. The `GameMatchup` struct includes a home and away `FootballTeam` and is primarily used in the API to define the game sim input payload. The `GameMatchupResult` enum includes three values, `Win`, `Loss`, and `Tie`. It is primarily used in the `league` module to tally team records.
